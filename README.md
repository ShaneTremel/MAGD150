# **Assignment Two**

+ This project is a showcase of my design skills
+ The scene is space, with a planet, stars, and ufo
+ I used ellipses, traingles, arcs, and beginShape() to make all of the shapes seen

# **Assignment Three**

+ This project is essentially a drawing board, with three different colors and an eraser avaible
+ This project uses the mouses location to draw lines, however lines are only drawn if the mouse is pressed
+ The weight of the brush is changed via the dist() command
+ I used if statements to check if mouseIsPressed, and if it is then it uses more if statements to check for key actions

**Instructions**
+ Use left / right arrow keys to change between the three colors (to get back to pink, press any key)
+ Use shift to erase, the eraser acts like another color as far as how to use it is concerned

# **Assignment Five**

+ This project is used to showcase design and other skills I learned throughout the semester
+ I used mouseClicked() function and if statements to change colors when neccessary
+ I also used one color pallet throughout the project 
+ Only problem I have in this project is being able to turn on the mouse and keyboard when the monitor is off

**Instructions**
+ To turn on computer, click the red circle
+ To turn off computer, click the yellow circle and press any key
+ To turn on keyboard, click on the keyboard... To turn on mouse, click on mouse
